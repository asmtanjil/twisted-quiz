 * I tried to use React Router properly in this project. This was my first challenge
 * I used Context API to pass data from a parent component to all child components instead of using props drilling.
 * Made dynamic route with id from given API.
 * I used a special route for Error handling in React app and also Netlify App.
 * Showing Quiz result into toast was not that easy.
