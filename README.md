        * Bullet list I tried to use React Router properly in this project. This was my first challenge
        * Bullet list I used Context API to pass data from a parent component to all child components instead of using props drilling.
        * Bullet list Made dynamic route with id from given API.
        * Bullet list I used a special route for Error handling in React app and also Netlify App.
        * Bullet list Showing Quiz result into toast was not that easy.
